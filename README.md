      Teams Page
    </a>

- What was your experience?
   - I'm trying to get back to coding since I'm an I.T Admin at a Daycare School and I'm starting afresh with HTML and CSS.

- What have you learned/improved?
  - Definitely learnt to use grids and media queries for responsiveness.
  - Flip text on an image.
  - Make images responsive.

- Your wisdom? :)
  - Tricky question :worried: , all I can tell myself is to learn to be consistent and most importantly, I'm looking for a Mentor.
